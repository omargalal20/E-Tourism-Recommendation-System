# E-Tourism-Recommendation-System

We used prolog to recommend to the customer an offer accordingly. See description behind project.

Travel agencies providing a knowledge base of the available offers they could recommend to customers. For
each of those offers, the accommodation and means of transportation is specified. Moreover, they all also
have knowledge about a customerâ€™s preferred accommodation, transportation and the type of activities
he/she would like to perform. As a result, the system should be provided with this data to be able to
recommend to the customer an offer accordingly.
